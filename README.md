# SHOOTdown

A short basic game I created as the last task during my summer internship.

The gameplay and the theme was up to me. Only instruction was to "make it colorful and simple".

Main Menu, spins around the ball and has a animated title.

Simple swipe to throw by mouse or touch. Knock down boxes to gain points.

Game over screen shows the score and gives the player the chance to play again for a better score.
